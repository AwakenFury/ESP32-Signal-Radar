## ESP32 Multi-Device RF Radar Dashboard

A real-time RF situational awareness and device tracking system powered by an ESP32 and a Python tactical dashboard.

This project combines Wi-Fi, BLE, and Classic Bluetooth scanning with motion sensing, IMU orientation tracking, and magnetometer heading data to visualize nearby wireless activity on a live radar-style interface.

The ESP32 continuously scans for nearby devices, estimates relative distance using RSSI signal strength, and streams telemetry over serial to a Python desktop dashboard that renders a tactical radar display with motion trails and device persistence.

## Features
 - Real-time Wi-Fi device scanning
 - BLE advertisement detection
 - Classic Bluetooth discovery
 - RSSI-based distance estimation
 - Radar-style tactical visualization
 - Device motion trails
 - OLED signal display on ESP32
 - MPU6050 orientation tracking
 - BMM150 magnetometer heading integration
 - Motion sensor detection
 - CSV logging system
 - Tamper/offline detection framework
 - Serial telemetry streaming
 - Multi-panel desktop dashboard
 - System Architecture
 - ESP32 Firmware

The ESP32 acts as the sensing and telemetry platform.

## It performs:

 - Wi-Fi network scans
 - BLE scans
 - Classic Bluetooth discovery
 - Motion detection
 - IMU orientation sampling
 - Magnetometer heading reads
 - OLED visualization
 - Serial telemetry transmission
 - Python Dashboard

The Python application receives serial telemetry from the ESP32 and renders a live tactical dashboard using Tkinter.
